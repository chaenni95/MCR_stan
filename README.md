The MCR_stan repository contains the materials for fully Bayesian mixture cure rate model with diverse survival distributions and link functions. 


`Rcode` - Contains all the Rcodes for the simulated data. The simulated data can be replaced with real data with the appropriate data structure for stan code 

`stan_code` - Contains the stan codes for three survival distributions: Weibull, lognormal, and loglogistic combined withe four link functions for the logistic regression on cure fraction: logit, slogit, rplogit, and fglogit defined in the pdf  

`pdf` - manuscript on the paper: Descriptions on the survival distribution and link functions can be found here  

`simulation2/plot` - simulation results
